Hey, creator of the bot here.

This package contains everything you need to run your own 90-9-1 subreddit.

CONTAINS:

obot.py ->  This file contains the parameters for the login of the bot.  You need to fill the blanks
with the ids that reddit gives you when you setup your app.

How to setup obot.py ->  Shortcut to a reddit link that explains how to setup obot.py to work with your bot.

css.txt ->  A nice css for the subreddit.  It also has the downvote arrow removed, the flairs already setup and some other stuff.

[SUBNAME]bot.py ->  This is the main bot.  You need to run it to kick and add members.  You'll have to edit some fields in there,
like the sub name and the parameters you want for the bot.  NOTE:  THE SUBREDDIT'S NAME IS CASE SENSITIVE.

WHAT TO DO BEFORE RUNNING THE BOT

1.  Create your subreddit.

2.  Create the bot's account and add it as a moderator to your subreddit.

3.  Make some comments on /r/freekarma or something like that using the bot's account.  This is to remove the CAPTCHA for when
the bot posts the recap.

4.  Set it up.  Here are the base settings:
	Subreddit Settings
		->  Type: Private
	Edit stylesheet
		->  Copy/Paste css.txt
	Edit flair
		->  Enable user flair in this subreddit
		->  Grant flair
			->  Jump to user: [Your username]
				->  flair text:  [ANYTHING YOU WANT]
				->  css class: special
			->  Jump to user: [Your bot]
				->  flair text:  [ANYTHING YOU WANT]
				->  css class: special

6.  Install python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

7.  Install PRAW (https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/stable/index.html#installation)

8.  Configure obot.py.

9.  Configure [SUBNAME]bot.py

10.  Run the bot!  Check if everything runs smoothly.  Also, notice at the end if it asks for a captcha.  If it does, farm more karma
with the bot's account.

AND VOILÀ!

After these 10 steps, you should see your first members rolling in.  If it didn't work for you, message /r/tretki and we'll get to you
ASAP to help you fix your problems.
